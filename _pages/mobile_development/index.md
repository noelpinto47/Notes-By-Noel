   - Integration tests
   - End-to-end tests

## Mobile Architecture Patterns

### Common Patterns

**MVC** (Model-View-Controller)
- Traditional separation of concerns
- Simple and widely understood

**MVVM** (Model-View-ViewModel)
- Data binding
- Testable business logic
- Popular in Flutter and React Native

**BLoC** (Business Logic Component)
- Stream-based state management
- Separates business logic from UI
- Popular in Flutter

**Clean Architecture**
- Domain-driven design
- Independent of frameworks
- Highly testable and maintainable

## App Deployment
