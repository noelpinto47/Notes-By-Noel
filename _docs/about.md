## The Story Behind This Site

Like many developers, I found myself constantly revisiting the same documentation, re-Googling solutions to problems I'd already solved, and wishing I had written down that clever solution I came up with six months ago.

**Notes By Noel** was born from that frustration.

## Philosophy

This site is guided by a few simple principles:

### üå± Learning is a Journey

Technology is constantly evolving, and so are these notes. Nothing here is "finished"‚Äîit's all a work in progress, just like our careers.

### üìö Document What You Learn

The best way to solidify learning is to teach it to others (or your future self). These notes serve that dual purpose.

### ü§ù Share Generously

The tech community thrives on knowledge sharing. If my notes can save someone else an hour of Googling, that's time well spent.

### ‚ú® Keep It Simple

No fancy features, no complicated setup. Just clean, searchable documentation that loads fast and works everywhere.

## What Makes This Different?

Unlike formal documentation or tutorials, these notes are:

- **Personal**: They reflect my learning path and the problems I've actually encountered
- **Practical**: Focus on real-world usage over theoretical perfection  
- **Opinionated**: When there are multiple ways to do something, I'll share what worked for me
- **Evolving**: Updated regularly as I learn new things or find better approaches

## Technical Details

### Built With

- **Jekyll** - A static site generator that's simple and powerful
- **Just the Docs** - A beautiful documentation theme with excellent search
- **Custom SCSS** - Warm green color scheme designed for comfortable reading
- **GitHub Pages** - Fast, free hosting (if deployed)

### Design Choices

The warm green color palette was chosen deliberately:

- **Green** promotes calmness and concentration
- **Soft tones** reduce eye strain during long reading sessions
- **High contrast** ensures readability for all users
- **Consistent spacing** creates a comfortable reading rhythm

- [ ] Community contributions
- [ ] Monthly learning recaps
