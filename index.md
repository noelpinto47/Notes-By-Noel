## About This Site

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to my personal knowledge garden. This is where I cultivate and share the notes I've gathered throughout my journey in technology. Think of this as a living document—it grows, evolves, and sometimes gets reorganized as I learn more.

### Why This Exists

Like many of you, I've found myself constantly Googling the same things, revisiting documentation, or digging through old notes. This site is my solution to that problem. It's a centralized place where I:

- 📝 **Document** solutions to problems I've encountered
- 🎯 **Organize** concepts and technologies I'm learning
- 🔗 **Curate** helpful resources and references
- 💡 **Share** insights that might help others on a similar path

### What You'll Find Here

This collection spans various topics in technology, including (but not limited to):

- Programming languages and frameworks
- Development tools and workflows
- System design and architecture
- Best practices and patterns
- Troubleshooting guides
- Useful commands and snippets
- Book notes and learning resources

## Exploring the Topics

The navigation sidebar on the left organizes notes by topic. Feel free to jump around—there's no required reading order here! Each section is designed to be self-contained, though I'll cross-reference related topics where relevant.

> **Note**: These are personal notes, so they reflect my learning journey and may contain opinions, shortcuts, or simplified explanations. Always refer to official documentation for authoritative sources.

## A Living Document

This site is constantly evolving. I regularly:

- ✨ Add new notes as I learn
- 🔄 Update existing content with new insights
- 🐛 Fix errors or outdated information
- 🌿 Reorganize sections for better clarity

If you spot something that could be improved or have suggestions, feel free to reach out!
